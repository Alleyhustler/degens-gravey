            <h1>On Loss and Lost Media</h1>
            <h5>Written: 2025-06-03</h5>
            <p><em>Gone but never forgotten</em></p>

            <p class="new-graph" style="margin-top: 19.5px">Re-making this website has me feeling some types of way. Especially while diving into the history of <a href="../pages/sidepages/buttonwall.html">web buttons</a> and making my own. I've been nostalgic, I guess, for my first steps through the world wide web, and the things I made along the way.</p>
            <p>This reminiscing came with a distressing realisation: most of what I'd created during that period, my childhood on the internet, particularly the visual elements (i.e. drawings, photography, graphic design), is gone. <em>Completely gone</em>.</p>

            <p class="new-graph">And it's not for the lack of trying - I flipped through all the folders and files in my hard drive, external archives, and the loose USBs where I knew I kept some stuff. Through those, I found names of websites and forums I'd visited in the mid/late 2000s and early 2010s - but most have gone offline, moved to new URLs which aren't valid, or through accounts I am certain I have nuked (<em>DeviantArt</em>, looking at you). And... nothing.</p>

            <p class="new-graph">Honestly? I... don't really know how to feel about it. That "art" was far from the best thing I've ever made: at best, it's cringe and not particularly pretty; at worst... it's... yeah... not great. Down right bad, to be honest. Makes you question your sense of taste... or sanity.</p>
            <p>But then again, this was a major part of my childhood. About 10 whole years on the internet during my formative time: interacting with people I didn't know from Adam and Eve, learning new skills and processes, participating in communities, and most importantly, creating so many things. So much so that I vividly remember organising my files with multiple CDs and USB keys, because there wasn't just one storage with enough space to hold it all (it was a different time, where 36MBs was <em>so much storage</em>).</p>
            <p>So part of me is devastated. Only being able to rely on my memory of forum banners and avatars, self-portraits on my first tablet (that I'd bought by myself with my babysitting money), terribly and overly edited snapshots, unfinished but still published drabbles, coloured-in linearts, and so many tests of online tutorials on how to use filters to make kick-ass graphic pictures.</p>
            <p>Worst thing, I guess, is being so sure of having created specific things (e.g. a mini Forum banners with <em>Cars</em> characters - yes the Pixar animated movie - made for my little brother because he loved the movie) but being unable to find it. <em>Even if it's so... so so so cringe</em>. It's especially hurting for the things <em>I know were actually good</em>. The ones I remember I got praise for (from the veterans of the Forums I used to visit, which I looked up to so much). One specifically, which had a lady on a swing, blowing bubbles. I remember spending hours on the filters to make it so dreamy.</p>
            <p><em>And it's all gone.</em></p>
            <p><small>I can pinpoint a couple of times, where I think I might have done something wrong during archiving/organising, and destroyed those files by mistake. Which is frustrating.</small></p>

            <p class="new-graph">Funnily, I'd made a <a href="https://manonamora.itch.io/zine-ctrlshiftzutalors" target="_blank">zine</a> last year, about imaginary future lost media. Not one second was I thinking about my own, actual, present, lost media. Ironic, isn't it?</p>

            <p class="new-graph">So, here I raise a glass. To the things I made all these years ago. That are gone for good. But won't ever be forgotten.</p>
            <p><small>BRB going to make a new backup of my current work, so I can be sure I won't lose <em>that</em>.</small></p>
