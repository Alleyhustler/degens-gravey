            <h1>June Check-In</h1>
            <h5>Written: 2025-06-02</h5>
            <p><em>Originally posted on Tumblr.</em></p>

            <p class="new-graph" style="margin-top: 19.5px">I am finally home! gots lots of feelings about it, but it can be TLDR's into a happy 5min scream of glee and relief.</p>
            <p>Obviously, because of the move, things were pretty busy IRL, especially during the last days/weeks. I'm not completely done with it, but it won't be as frantic (mainly waiting to hear back on things). Hopefully by the middle of the summer, all the boxes will be checked!</p>
            <p>TLDR: NEW WEBSITE YALL! and a plan for June.</p>

            <h2 class="new-graph">What I've been up to in May?</h2>

            <p class="new-graph">Not much in terms of releases. Actually... nothing at all. Didn't even manage to push some bug fixes for Harcourt. But!</p>

            <h3 class="new-graph">MY WEBSITE IS UP TO DATE Y'ALL!</h3>

            <p class="new-graph">A fresh new version (v3<sup>*</sup>!), going in a completely different direction from the previous iterations. At the same time, it is very much a continuation of what I imagined the website to become.</p>
            <small>* 3 is actually my favourite number. I think it was meant to be, that the best version of this website would happen on version 3...</small>
            <p style="text-align: right;">Anyway... <strong><a href="../../home.html">LOOK AT THIS BEAUTY!!!</a></strong></p>
            <p class="new-graph">I'm so so freaking happy with how it turned out. Reorganising the sections, and giving everything a lot more personality is making me elated about this space. And this new version is allowing me to grow the website however I want and wherever creating brings me (branching out to different mediums maybe?).</p>
            <p style="text-align: right;"><strong><a href="../../pages/sidepages/buttonwall.html">AND LOOT AT THE BUTTONS ≺333333</a></strong></p>
            <p>Returning to the old school web vibes is everything I needed, ngl.</p>
            <p class="new-graph">So yea, go through my little computer/website. There are tons of pages with different interfaces (and there will be more soon!).</p>
            <p>Fair warning: it is absolutely not mobile friendly (currently). Anything smaller than 1200x768 will give some really weird results. Also, use Firefox to view it.</p>
            <p class="new-graph">I still have a huge TO-DO list of things and polish to do (incl. mobile) but at least, all the info from V2 has been moved to V3, and what was missing (games/assets/etc...) has finally been added (if not a full page, it's at least mentioned somewhere).</p>

            <h3 class="new-graph">Neo-Interactives and other Events</h3>
            <p class="new-graph" style="padding-top: 3px;">May is <a href="https://itch.io/jam/really-bad-if-2" target="_blank">REALLY BAD IF</a> month, between the end of the previous and next cycle of competitions, where people are tasked to make the absolute worst IF game possible. Normally it's just the month of may, but... I announced it late everywhere, and I didn't manage to put my entry in time, so... it's extended until the end of June!</p>

            <p class="new-graph">I forgot at the end to officially announce the 2025 Showcase. Gotta put myself a reminder to do that.</p>

            <p class="new-graph">Also announced in May (though it only just started), <a href="https://itch.io/jam/the-summer-of-translations" target="_blank">The Summer of Translations</a>! Because I honestly needed accountability buddies to ensure I actually upload a new translation every week (which will happen every Sunday!).</p>

            <p class="new-graph">Keep an eye on @ifcomp for announcements, too. I'm still handling Social Media this year, and we're slowly getting ready to open the new edition of the Comp.</p>

            <p class="new-graph">And finally, Neo-Twiny Jam is coming back, again a fundraiser (we got a few donors already!). We're hopping to break all the records again, so consider participating for a good cause (or share, that helps tons) !!</p>
            <p>Check @neointeractives and @neo-twiny-jam for announcements and entries :)</p>
            <p>And I'll be restarting @manonamora-if-reviews with my comments on the entries!</p>

            <h3 class="new-graph">Translations Project</h3>

            <p class="new-graph" style="padding-top: 3px;">Nothing is out before June, but I manage to create a little bit of a buffer for myself (a couple of games buffer) in case things get busy IRL for a few weeks and whatnot. Which makes me pretty happy!</p>
            <p>Now... having received pages long of pointing out mistakes from MelS... But he said I'm getting better!</p>

            <p class="new-graph">And... that's all folks :P</p>
            <p>The website took most of my very little free time this month.</p>

            <h2 class="new-graph">The PLANtm for June</h2>

            <p class="new-graph">Al-right-y, let's make a list!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Harcourt:</em> pushing the fixes ASAP (and pray there won't be any new bugs) and nag MelS for the missing Codex pages.</li>
                <li><em>Summer of Translations:</em> upload 5 translated works (incl. new releases) <- one less to do because Collision is done!</li>
                <li><em>Website:</em> chip away at the To-Do list (I'm making moar buttons)</li>
                <li><em>RBIF:</em> fix the bug and upload the entry</li>
                <li><em>NTJ:</em> try to at least make one entry (potentially with Anti-Romance and Nouvim, two birds one stone) - I have 3 ideas already, just need to make them happen.</li>
                <li><em>Reviews:</em> Neo-Twiny here we come!</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="new-graph">Not so much of a plan, more of what to expect this month, which... won't be much. Because the thing is: I'm moving at the end of the month. So between packing, selling, cancelling stuff here, and unpacking, opening, and probably buying things there, my IRL To-Do is arm-length at this point. It's both super stressful and a huge relief.<br>
            I picked such a good time to come back, lol.</p>

            <h2 class="new-graph">Updates on 2025's progress</h2>

            <p class="new-graph">Is... void. lol. Which means I'm sticking to the plan!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I haven't submitted to any event so far (outside of Showcases for stuff already out! and the Translation project, but those don't count)</li>
                <li>No new events organised either! (aside from the Translation one, but that's for keeping me accountable, so it doesn't count either)</li>
                <li>I've done some fixes for a previously released game (Harcourt, it's just not pushed yet - I got sent a couple of more typos to fix)</li>
                <li>The website is up-to-date!</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="new-graph">Depending on how things go in June, I might have a more concrete plan for the rest of the year in my mid-year check-in. As in: picking a WIP and finish it in those next 6 months.</p>
