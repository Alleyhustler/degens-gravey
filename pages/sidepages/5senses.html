                            <p><em>Begezus, what the fuck is this book?</em> That's what I kept thinking reading it. 9/11 conspiracy meets Cold War spy meets capitalism and ads are the worst meets internet communities and rabbit hole. <em>There should always be space for coincidences.</em> Speculative fiction is great, and can be completely bonkers. I love it. I still don't know what to think of this book. <em>Conspiracies are not about you, you're just a pawn in other people's games.</em> Huge recommend. Loved the whole weird allergy to brands and the internet communities.</p>

                            <p>Should have DNF'd when I stopped half-way through. Such a bore. 300 pages could have been cut out of this book. And for what? A depressing journey of someone rising through the ranks, finding love and happiness, and getting everything yanked away from him bit by bit. Somehow the last man surviving a plague? Did make me chuckle a tiny bit at times, seeing our present mirroring some scenes (which is probably why I tried to finish the book).</p>

                            <p>Yeah, the dramatisation of sumo is everywhere. Enno is allowed a lot more leeway for the shit he pulls compared to real life. It's pretty cringe at the start too, but the latter episodes are much better. A good progression on the main story, as the protagonists are learning more about sumo and learning to appreciate and love it. I still can't buy that the very obviously middle-aged actor plays a 19-something kid. The female characters are pretty one-note and all of them are awful people (tbf, no one here is not terrible). Shimizu's arc was bitter sweet, Shizuuchi had the best story line (never says a word), and the hair cutting ceremony was a tear-jerker. I liked that it ended so open-ended (usually hate that!). Good for entertainment, not for a proper representation of the sport.</p>

                            <p>Hate the combat system and its fucking spell slots and rests mechanics. Main story is a bit generic, but fine. Companions are pretty good: Karlach is such a cutie nerd, Gale is so funny at times, I get the hype about Astarion but I also don't <em>get it</em> (he's just fine). The exploration and looting is fun. It's a very gorgeous game. Still preferring <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> and <em>Divinity Original Sin</em> so far.</p>

                            <p><em>What the Fuck was that?</em> The title and credit sequences are bonkers and so aesthetically pleasing. The story is so fucking weird and sad and sweet (give or take some moments). It's like coming-of-age meets multiverse meets apocalypse meets alien contact meets criticism of dependence on American's military? Very much friendship is magic but in a very fucked up way.</p>

                            <p>Had been on my to-read list for years, only got a copy recently. Maybe the best book I've read this year. I'm a sucker for Ancient Greek/Roman retelling, even more for a <em>Women being badasses and doing their thing</em>, and Le Guin is one of my favourite author ever. It's not my favourite Le Guin book, still a very good one. It was hard to put the book down, really devoured it. A forever keep.</p>

                            <p>Spent a couple of months on it, playing a couple of hours at a time. A very solid introduction to the new protagonist of Yakuza (a complete psychotic dumb dumb, a golden retriever with no common sense). As hilarious and silly as it is serious and heartbreaking. Twist on twist on twist. Still a bit grindy at the end, and the 2/3rd boss fight being insanely frustrating. Top 10/10 side-quests. Not super fond of the management side (very same-y), but that side-story was fun anyway. Still can't win a fucking game of shogi or mahjong to save my life.</p>

                            <p>Went into it with low expectations after seeing the last trailers. Loved the book, so always iffy about adaptations. It was... <em>just fine</em>. Didn't like the Scoobie-Doo main cast (didn't feel for them or their ordeals). The investigator was just... fine. Both actresses playing Ye Wenjie were great (best storyline)! Sophon is batshit insane but in a good way. Intrigued about the other 2 seasons, but won't hold my breath. 6/10. Decent adaptation for the Western market, though <em>eh</em> on them tacking part of Book 2 at the end.</p>
