                <p>Since the start of 2022, I've been trying to be more involved in the Interactive Fiction community, whether by taking part in events, organising my own, or moderating groups. These experiences have been very fulfilling and helped me grow as a creator, community member and person.</p>
                <p>Below you will find a non-exhaustive list of my involvement in IF communities. For a list of events organised, <a href="events.html">click here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Neo-Interactives</h2>
                <p>I co-founded this collective back in July 2023, along with <a href="https://autumnchen.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Autumn Chen</a>, <a href="https://lapinlunaire-games.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Lapin Lunaire Games</a>, and Sophia de Augustine. This hub aims to <strong>foster the exchange of ideas and game creation</strong>, through discussions on its <a href="https://discord.gg/NP6c6aAKfK" target="_blank">Discord</a> and a multitude of unranked game jams throughout the year.</p>
                <p>Our events are open to all, regardless of language, coding engine, or form of Interactive Fiction. Each event provide a constraint: a theme, a word limit, or restrictive mechanic, etc... The goal of these events is to provide a space for people to experiment with the medium without pressure or expectations.</p>
                <p>This collective is now 500+ members strong.</p>

                <h2>IFiction-FR</h2>
                <p>Started in the early noughties, <em>IFiction-FR</em> is an IF group catered to Francophone users and creations. Throughout the year, the community organises its annual competition and smaller game jams, promoting French Interactive Fiction. On their <a href="http://www.fiction-interactive.fr/" target="_blank">website</a>, they regularly publish articles: IF-related news, coding tutorials, deep-dives into games or topics, and interviews of community members.</p>
                <p>Since discovering the group in 2022, I have participated to many of their events (winning the 2023 French Comp), organised some too (<em>Confiture de Parser</em>), and contributed a couple of articles to the <a href="http://www.fiction-interactive.fr/author/manonamora/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

                <h2>Write Club</h2>
                <p>Though mainly dormant now, I have been moderating the small <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nKsbp8bA92" target="_blank">Discord</a> group of (mainly IF) writers. First set up late 2022, it aims to help creators motivate each other, share advice and resources, as well as provide feedback.</p>
                <p>During 2023 until the first half of 2024, I used to lead a weekly writing circle, for motivation purposes. The writing circle would usually happen Friday to Sunday, in a voice chat, where participants would talk about their progress, be able to ask for help, or share advice.</p>

                <h2>Interact-IF</h2>
                <p>From 2022 to mid-2024, I moderated the <em>Interact-IF</em> group, which started in 2021 as a directory of Interactive Fiction related content on Tumblr, with the aim to build a stronger IF community on that platform.</p>
                <p>Its activities ranges from promoting IF projects and events, sharing coding and writing resources, creating recommendation lists, helping its members find specific works, and promoting diversity in IF.</p>
                <p>During my tenure, I spearheaded the creation of <a href="https://interact-if.tumblr.com/database" target="_blank">database</a> of Tumblr-based projects, the <a href="https://interact-if.tumblr.com/post/688164207318990848/" target="_blank">Author Appreciation</a> event, and the promotion of IF events (jams, competitions, conferences, etc...). I also interviewed dozens of diverse IF authors, and managed the inbox.</p>
                <p>Before I left, the blog had reached over 10k followers, and 900+ members on Discord.</p>
