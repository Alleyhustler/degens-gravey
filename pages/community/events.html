                    <h3>SeedComp!</h3>
                    <p>Starting as a wild idea in an IntFiction thread, the <em>SeedComp!</em> is a 2-round competition focusing on creativity and growth of ideas. Originally put together in about 14 days late 2022, the competition has run three editions.</p>
                    <p>During the first round, creators can submit a <em>seed</em> of any medium or format (e.g. prompt, assets, code, etc...). In the following second round, participants must use one of these seeds to create a whole new game.</p>

                    <h3>Neo Twiny Jam</h3>
                    <p>Commemorating the <em>Twiny Jam</em>, a historial IF even organised by Porpentine, the <em>Neo-Twiny</em> jam is a yearly month-long game jam hosted during the month of June. It only has one constraint: every participant is limited to 500 words. How they choose to utilise those, how they tell their story, or which IF engine to use, is left up to them.</p>
                    <p>With June celebrating Pride Month, the <em>Neo-Twiny</em> jam is also a fundraiser - matching the number of submissions into a donation to diverse LGBTQ+ charities. We raised $500+ in 2023, and $600+ in 2024.</p>
                    <p>The jam ran in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/neo-twiny-jam" target="_blank">2023</a>, <a href="https://itch.io/jam/neo-twiny-jam-24" target="_blank">2024</a>, and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/neo-twiny-jam-25" target="_blank">2025</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Neo-Interactives events</h3>
                    <p>Under this collective, there have been dozens of events run (recurring and one-off).</p>
                    <h4>Single Choice Jam</h4>
                    <p>A month-long recurring jam challenging creators to only provide one choice/action in their games. It ran in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/single-choice-jam" target="_blank">2023</a>, <a href="https://itch.io/jam/single-choice-jam-24" target="_blank">2024</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/single-choice-jam-25" target="_blank">2025</a>.</p>
                    <h4>Bring Out Your Ghost</h4>
                    <p>Inspired by Short's <em>Bring Out Your Dead Jam</em>, a yearly recurring jam to show off the ghosts of unfinished projects or ideas that never came to be. It also welcomes finished projects revisited thanks to the jam. It ran in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bring-out-your-ghosts">2023</a>, <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bring-our-your-ghost-24">2024</a> and 2025.</p>
                    <h4>Bare-Bones Jam</h4>
                    <p>A yearly recurring jam where participants are prohibited from changing any element of the interface of their chosen program (e.g. edit the CSS) - aiming to focus on the writing. It ran in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bare-bones-jam" target="_blank">2023</a>, <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bare-bones-jam-24" target="_blank">2024</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bare-bones-jam-25" target="_blank">2025</a>.</p>
                    <h4>ShuffleComp</h4>
                    <p>A yearly musical competition based on the original <em>ShuffleComp</em> of the 2010s. Creators have to make a game based on one or more songs. Songs are submitted during registrations, before randomly assigned to each participant. It ran in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/shufflecomp-2023" target="_blank">2023</a>, <a href="https://itch.io/jam/shufflecomp-2024" target="_blank">2024</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/shufflecomp-2025" target="_blank">2025</a></p>
                    <h4>Smoochie Jam</h4>
                    <p>A month-long recurring jam all about romance and kisses (the anti-thesis of the <em>Anti-Romance jam</em>). It ran in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/smoochie-jam-24" target="_blank">2024</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/smoochie-jam-25" target="_blank">2025</a></p>
                    <h4>Dialogue Jam</h4>
                    <p>A month-long recurring jam restricting creators to writing only dialogue, in all its forms (incl. monologue, epistolary, script etc...). It ran in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/dialogue-jam-24">2024</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/dialogue-jam-25">2025</a></p>
                    <h4>Mini-Jams</h4>
                    <p>During 2024, we decided to run a handful of 10-days long jams in between the events mentioned above. Each of these had a specific restriction: <a href="https://itch.io/jam/recipe-jam-24" target="_blank">Recipe Jam</a> asked to include a recipe, <a href="https://itch.io/jam/if-revival-jam-2024" target="_blank">Revival Jam</a> was inspired by past events <a href="https://itch.io/jam/locus-jam-24" target="_blank">Locus Jam</a> constrained the player to one room, <a href="https://itch.io/jam/anti-productivity-jam-24" target="">Anti-Productivity Jam</a> barred creators from using IF engines, and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/educational-jam-24" target="_blank">Education Jam</a> looked to teach players something.</p>
                </article>
                <article id="orifice-jam">
                    <h3>Orifice Jam</h3>
                    <p>Inspired by the work of Porpentine, the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/orifice-jam" target="_blank">Orifice Jam</a> hoped to inspire creators to explore the cavernous caves of non-traditional and NSFW IF. Entries or exits, participants played with holes in all their glories.<br>
                    This one-off unranked jam ran from June to August 2023.</p>

                <h2>Solo events</h2>
                <article id="showcase">
                    <h3>Interactive Fiction Showcase</h3>
                    <p>With so many events happening throughout the year, I wanted to create a space for IF creators to promote their completed games - especially if released outside of competitions and jams. The showcase is open to all forms of IF, languages, and engines.</p>
                    <p>The Showcase ran in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/interactive-fiction-showcase-2024">2024</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/interactive-fiction-showcase-2025">2025</a></p>
                </article>
                <article id="really-bad">
                    <h3>Really Bad IF Jam</h3>
                    <p>Following discussions about the quality of IF games (i.e. what makes a good game <em>good</em>) the pressures of making things, and the receptions from players, I started the <em>REALLY BAD IF</em> jam - partly as a joke, partly because the concept seemed fun.</p>
                    <p>The original joke was to make terrible games that would warrant 1-star ratings on the IFDB. While ironing out the "rules", participants are challenged to create the absolute worst IF game they can think of. Whether using mechanics that frustrate everyone, creating game-breaking bugs, having questionable writing, or eye-bleeding interfaces... the goal is to have fun making silly things without the anxiety of reception.</p>
                    <p>What resulted from this series was a wide-range of entries with varying quality, and take on what makes a game actually bad. From absolutely awful and unplayable, to surprisingly fun, and even actually good they were disqualified, the responses of this series was extremely positive, both from players and creators.</p>
                    <p>This jam ran in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/really-bad-if" target="_blank">2024</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/really-bad-if-2" target="_blank">2025</a>.</p>

                <article id="confiture">
                    <h3>Confiture de Parser</h3>
                    <p>This summer-long jam is a chill event hosted with the aim of promoting the creation of francophone parsers within the community. It also provides a space for authors to make parsers without pressure or constraints, whether it is their first ever parser or they are trying out a new engine.</p>
                    <p>Since the francophone community is relatively small, the event usually ends with only a handful of entries.</p>
                    <p>This jam ran in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/confiture-de-parser">2024</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/confiture-de-parser2">2025</a></p>
                </article>
                <article id="translation">
                    <h3>Summer of Translations</h3>
                    <p>Spawned from a personal summer project, this jam aims to promote narrative projects that include non-English languages.</p>
                    <p>The jam will run from <a href="https://itch.io/jam/the-summer-of-translations" target="_blank">June to August 2025.</a></p>

                    <h3>Anti-Romance Jam</h3>
                    <p>Open to all narrative mediums, the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/anti-romance">Anti-Romance Jam</a> fostered a space for creators to reflect on the themes of romance and its antonyms, play with the codes of the genre, and defined what <em>Anti-Romance</em> means.</p>
                    <p>For this unranked event, I provided support and assistance in moderation and promotion of the event for its <a href="https://itch.io/jam/anti-romance">2023</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/anti-romance-2024">2024</a> editions.</p>

                    <h3>Interactive Fiction Competition</h3>
                    <p>The <em>IFComp</em> is THE major event of the Interactive Fiction calendar. Held yearly since 1995, the <a href="https://ifcomp.org/" target="_blank">competition</a> celebrates new, text-driven digital games and stories from independent creators.</p>
                    <p>After participating in 2022, I joined the organising team in 2023 as the Communication Head, organising posting in social media and moderating the IFComp section on the IntFiction forum.</p>
